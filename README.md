# Background

This directory contains some code to check compliance of proposals submitted to NASA [ROSES](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/roses-blogs) calls.

Code author: Megan Ansdell [@mansdell](https://github.com/mansdell)

# Setup

### Required Non-standard Packages

[PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): a useful package for importing PDF text (which confusingly is imported as "import fitz")

### Inputs

The code requires two inputs:
1) Path to the anonymized proposal PDF (PDF_Anon_Path)
2) Path to a CSV file with the team member first names, last names, instutitions, and cities (Team_Info_Path). An example is provided in this repo.



# Description
  
### check_dapr_single.py

This code reads in an anonymized proposal submitted to a ROSES program that follows Dual-Anonymous Peer Reivew (DAPR). It attempts to find the different sections of the proposal (STM, References, Budget) and then checks a variety of things to make sure it is DAPR compliant. It outputs the following:

* Page ranges for the STM and References sections
  - These assume the following order: STM, References, Other (e.g., budget)
  - They're usually correct, but sometimes they're not; this only really matters for searching for the team member namesâ€”if the code got the references section wrong, it'll probably incorrectly flag the team member names as being in the main proposal text.
  
* Reference format
  - DAPR proposals are supposed to use bracketed number references, rather than "et al." references
  - The code reports the number of brackets found in the proposal and number of "et al." usages in proposal (the former number should be high, the latter low)
  
* Forbidden DAPR words
  - DAPR proposal shouldn't include any identifying team member information (names, institutions, cities, genders)
  - The code reports number of times such things are found and the page numbers on which they are found
