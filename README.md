# Background

This directory contains some code to check compliance of proposals submitted to NASA [ROSES](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/roses-blogs) calls.

Code author: Megan Ansdell [@mansdell](https://github.com/mansdell)

# Setup

### Required Non-standard Packages

[PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): a useful package for importing PDF text (which confusingly is imported as "import fitz")

### Inputs

The code requires two inputs:
1) Path to the anonymized proposal PDF (PDF_Anon_Path)
2) Path to a CSV file with the team member first names, last names, instutitions, and cities (Team_Info_Path). An example is provided in this repo.



# Description
  
### check_dapr_single.py

This code reads in an anonymized proposal submitted to a ROSES program that follows Dual-Anonymous Peer Reivew (DAPR). It attempts to find the different sections of the proposal (STM, References, Budget) and then checks a variety of things to make sure it is DAPR compliant. It outputs the following:

* Page ranges for the STM and References sections
  - These assume the following order: STM, References, Other (e.g., budget)
  - They're usually correct, but sometimes they're not; this only really matters for searching for the team member names—if the code got the references section wrong, it'll probably incorrectly flag the team member names as being in the main proposal text.
  
* Reference format
  - DAPR proposals are supposed to use bracketed number references, rather than "et al." references
  - The code reports the number of brackets found in the proposal and number of "et al." usages in proposal (the former number should be high, the latter low)
  
* Forbidden DAPR words
  - DAPR proposal shouldn't include any identifying team member information (names, institutions, cities, genders)
  - The code reports number of times such things are found and the page numbers on which they are found
